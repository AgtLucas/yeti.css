    h4 Regular Modals
    p 
      | All modals are divs with class 
      code.inline-light modal
      |  and need to be triggered by Javascript.


    h4 Modals with no header
    p
      | Sometimes you need a simple modal without header and just paragraph with buttons. Use the class 
      code.inline-light modal-no-head
      |  and omit the 
      code.inline-light modal-head
      |  container.

    h4 Overlay
    p 
      | If you need to cover the content of the page to display the overlay (probably most cases) &mdash; you will need an 
      code.inline-light overlay
      |  div appended to body of the page or 
      code.inline-light has-modal
      |  class added to the 
      code.inline-light body
      |   element. Both will create an semi-transparent black overlay.
